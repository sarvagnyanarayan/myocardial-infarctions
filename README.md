## Project Title

Myocardial Infarction Complications

## Project Description

Our project goals are to predict complications of Myocardial Infarctions
(MI) based on various patient attributes. 

We explore four specific complications - chronic heart failure, atrial fibrilation, pulmonary edema and relapse of the myocardial infarction. We will analyze these complications through selected input features. From this analysis, we build classification models for each complication and compare performance.

## Dataset Description

The University of California at Irvine (UCI) maintains multiple datasets
used for various ML tasks. The Myocardial Infarction Complications
dataset was donated by the University of Leicester. The dataset contains
different complications related to MI and measures a variety of inputs
related to the patient upon admission to the hospital, the ends of the
first, second and third days.The various complications include but are
not limited to Atrial Fibrilation, Supraventricular Tachycardia,
Ventrircular Tachycardia, etc. The input features measured for each
patient included but are not limited to age, gender, sex, first-degree
AV block in the anamnesis, etc.

For our exploratory analysis we will only look a certain number of the
most common complications by selected input features.
